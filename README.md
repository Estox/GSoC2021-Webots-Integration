Google Summer of Code 2021
--------------------------

This repository is the result of the 2021 Google Summer of Code idea "Webots integration with RoboComp" suggested by RoboComp. The project was mentored by Ronit Jorvekar and Daniel Rodríguez and done by a student Kacper Kujawski. For more detailed information about the work done during GSoC, containing changes in code and new code, check out the [commit history](https://github.com/Estox/GSoC2021-Webots-Integration/commits/master) of this repository.

Requirements
------------

1. RoboComp https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp.git
2. Webots https://cyberbotics.com/

Usage of the program was described in the documentation, so please refer to that.

Features
--------

* Simulating the work of RoboComp components in several scenarios.
* Some simple examples are implemented for quick use.
* Customizable world for the user to create infinite number of simulations.
* Expandable for another components with little effort.

Current Constraints
-------------------

* No automatic addition of the same devices.
* Some component methods for devices have no use.
* There are only movement platforms created for robots.

Ideas
-----

* Adding more finished objects.
* Adding more devices controlled by stable components.
* Adding more robots and more sophisticated controllers for them.

Conclusion
----------

This project was something entirely new for me and it was an amazing experience, since I've never worked with an open-source programs. I have learned a lot from my mentors, so I would also like to thank them here: Ronit Jorvekar and Daniel Rodríguez alongside other RoboComp members, who helped me from time to time. This project was great for me because it didn't require me to do many difficult tasks and at the same time it was very challenging at times.
